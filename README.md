# Convolution-and-autoencoding

The model in the given code is a simple autoencoder that takes an image as input, compresses it through convolutional layers to a lower-dimensional representation, and then reconstructs the image back from this compressed representation through deconvolutional layers.

I am saving all the activations of all the layers.
