# Convolution-and-autoencoding

The aim of this project is to understand convolution layers .
Hence for each layer , I am saving the layer-output images in a separate folder for visualization.

To add to the aim , I have made a simple autoencoder type model structure ,
In the model achitecture the first 4 layers are downsampling the inuput image , later 4 are upsampling , regularisation and relu activation is used .

you can see the input vs output image,

the areas which i believe (for now) that can be imporved are , change in model architecutre by adding skip connections like RESNets and changing the loss function . 

The project for now is completed.
